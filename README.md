# PizzaHut-SQL-Project
This SQL project is designed to analyze and retrieve various insights from a pizza sales database. 
The database consists of multiple tables, including orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types. 
The project involves writing queries to extract and analyze data at different levels of complexity.
This project aims to showcase the ability to handle a range of SQL queries, providing valuable insights into pizza sales and helping improve decision-making based on data-driven analysis. By analyzing order quantities, revenue, distribution patterns, and top-performing items, the project delivers a comprehensive understanding of the sales performance and trends within the pizza business.I'm excited to share my latest SQL project, which focuses on analyzing pizza sales data to extract meaningful insights. This project involves working with a comprehensive database containing multiple tables, including orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types. Below is a brief overview of the project objectives and the SQL queries used to achieve them.
